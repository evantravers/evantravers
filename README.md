# Hi there!

I’m a grace-saved sinner that lives in Birmingham, Alabama. I like to tell stories and make tools. I like to write a good bit, but unfortunately I like to tinker more, so I end up tweaking CSS more than writing essays about it.

I’m [@evantravers](https://twitter.com/evantravers) nearly everywhere you are, so give me a follow if you want.
